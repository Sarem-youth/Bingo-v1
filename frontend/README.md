# Frontend

This directory will contain the frontend application code (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).

## Initial Setup (Example for React with Create React App)

1.  Navigate to this directory: `cd frontend`
2.  Create a new React app: `npx create-react-app .` (or your preferred method)
3.  Install necessary libraries like `axios` for API calls, `react-router-dom` for routing.
    `npm install axios react-router-dom`

## Structure (Typical for React)

-   `public/` (static assets, index.html)
-   `src/`
    -   `components/` (reusable UI components)
    -   `pages/` (top-level page components)
    -   `contexts/` or `store/` (state management, e.g., Context API, Redux)
    -   `services/` (API service calls)
    -   `hooks/` (custom React hooks)
    -   `assets/` (images, fonts, etc.)
    -   `App.js` (main application component)
    -   `index.js` (entry point)
