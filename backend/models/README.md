# Models

This directory is for database models or schemas.
If using an ORM like Sequelize or Mongoose, model definitions would go here.
If using direct database queries, this might contain functions that interact with the database.

Example (Sequelize):
- `user.model.js`
- `company.model.js`

Example (Mongoose):
- `UserSchema.js`
